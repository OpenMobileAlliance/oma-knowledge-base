As a non-profit entity with deep roots in mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) innovation, OMA SpecWorks has been instrumental in the development of key protocols, most notably the OMA LightweightM2M (LwM2M). This protocol has become a cornerstone for IoT device management, enabling efficient and secure communication between devices across diverse wireless networks. By bringing together leading industry players, OMA SpecWorks ensures the creation of market-accelerating standards that facilitate seamless interoperability across both fixed and mobile wireless networks.",{"type":14,"tag":15,"props":22,"children":23},{},[24],{"type":19,"value":25},"Members of OMA SpecWorks collaborate in a transparent and egalitarian environment, where companies of all sizes can contribute equally to the advancement of wireless technology standards. The organization’s commitment to producing high-quality technical outputs has been demonstrated through the success of protocols like LwM2M, which is now widely adopted in sectors such as healthcare, automotive, utilities, and home automation. By merging with the IPSO Alliance in 2018, OMA SpecWorks further strengthened its mission to develop comprehensive technical documents—ranging from specifications to smart objects and white papers—supporting the ongoing evolution of the connected world and ensuring that protocols like LwM2M continue to lead the way in IoT device
