OMNA simplifies the process for users by providing clear guidelines and a streamlined approach to navigate these registries. This includes submitting requests for assigned names, IDs, numbers, or objects, which are then reviewed and recorded in OMNAâ€™s database, ensuring consistent use across OMA implementations. Through these registries, OMNA supports seamless integration within the OMA ecosystem, fostering a reliable and cohesive environment for technology deployment."}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"how-the-omna-process-works"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"How the OMNA Process Works"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The OMNA process, currently based on the WINA process established by WAP, guides the allocation of names and numbers.
