It comes on the main chipset inside the IoT device's communication module, thus making a separate SIM component obsolete.

Accordingly, the handling of physical SIMs is replaced by a fully digital process, ideal for the emerging IoT mass-market."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Many IoT use cases can be satisfied with a one-time profile provisioning at device manufacturing so the profile remains operational until the device’s end-of-life.
