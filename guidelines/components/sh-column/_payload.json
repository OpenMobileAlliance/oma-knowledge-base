It is there so we can differentiate e.g. `wrapper` for the whole constructor and `wrapper` only for the `header` section. So basically, we cannot style `header` with classes but only objects inside of it. What could we do if we wanted to add class to `header` is either target the `header.wrapper` or we can concatenate classes like in the picture below on the line 3\\n\\n![ui.header](/images/faq/sh-column.ui.header.png)\\n\"},{\"q\":\"Is `size` a property or an attribute? Can we style it?\\n\",\"a\":\"`Size` is a property with values of a whole number. This number represents an element in an array from `sh-grid-sizes.ts`. In this case, it takes the value of an element from `colSpan` array. So if we wanted to style it, we would have to change something in `sh-grid-sizes.ts`, but since the value of size is a number and it is used specially for grid, adding some other style in array would not make much sense.\\n\"},{\"q\":\"Is `main` an attribute or property?
