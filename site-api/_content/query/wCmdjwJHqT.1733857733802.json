A gateway may translate addresses, protocols, or commands along the IoT service path. As various types of gateways proliferate in IoT services, the communication security between sender and receiver depends on the security of each hop combined with business agreements and trust relations between the involved parties. Hop-by-hop security offers more points of attack and is a greater risk to the IoT service as IoT proxies such as application-layer gateways and middleboxes may alter the messages they forward at various protocol layers in the stack. The theme of this paper is that IoT data must be secure in transit and securing data at the transport layer alone is not always sufficient for preserving integrity and confidentiality through proxies, gateways or other middleboxes. Application-layer security is needed for many IoT service topologies to prevent critical data from becoming unprotected in middleboxes. The paper gives real-world use cases for application-layer end-to-end IoT security and describes the Open Mobile Alliance solution to these types of use cases."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"You can download the PDF "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.openmobilealliance.org/documents/whitepapers/OMA-WP-e2e_Sec_IoT-20191024-A.pdf","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"here"}]},{"type":"text","value":"."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://omaspecworks.org/contact-us/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Contact us"}]},{"type":"text","value":" for more information."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Let's keep in touch, "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://account.openmobilealliance.org/AccountCreation/GetAccount.asp","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"sign up here"}]},{"type":"text","value":"."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:5.news:articles:2019-07-30-E2E-security-for-IoT.md","_source":"content","_file":"5.news/articles/2019-07-30-E2E-security-for-IoT.md","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/news/articles/2020-01-23-lwm2m-5g","_dir":"articles","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"White Paper - OMA LwM2M - Ready for 5G","description":"The IoT movement and 5G will grow at one of technology’s fastest rates in coming years.

These are just a few examples where metrics being collected may involve measuring, listening, watching, and of course studying metrics that may be unique or specific to an industry or use case. A one-size-fits-all dashboard approach often falls short in providing meaningful insights, which is why customizability is essential. Effective IoT dashboards should allow users to customize the data displayed, set unique KPIs, and design layouts suited to their operational requirements. Flexible data visualization options like charts, graphs, heatmaps, and geographical data overlays enhance usability and make the data easy to interpret. APIs also allow the integration of systems and data that may already be made available to overlay unique data to make more informed decisions. The flexibility to adjust these elements ensures that your IoT dashboard remains relevant as organizations or business use case needs evolve."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"data-integration-and-interoperability"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Data Integration and Interoperability"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"IoT deployments involve a variety of data sources, including sensors, cloud services, and third-party platforms. Therefore, dashboard tools must offer seamless integration capabilities to unify this data and present it cohesively.  As mentioned, key integrations may include APIs for cloud providers, data storage platforms, ERP systems, or CRM solutions, allowing organizations to leverage comprehensive data insights. Tools that support multiple protocols (e.g., LwM2M, MQTT, HTTP, CoAP) and data formats simplify integration and reduce compatibility issues, helping to create a streamlined IoT ecosystem. Strong interoperability ensures that dashboard analytics remain scalable and adaptable to future technologies.\nCities increasingly use API integrations to bolster data analytics and improve services, especially within IoT-driven smart city projects. For example, cities within the Civic Analytics Network, such as Boston, have implemented API-based data platforms to centralize analytics for public safety, housing, and transportation improvements. These APIs allow data collected from citywide sensors—like traffic or environmental data—to be synthesized and analyzed in real time. This approach has led to effective, data-driven responses to urban challenges, enabling better resource allocation and infrastructure management. Additionally, cities like Dallas have used APIs in conjunction with smart street lighting and traffic management systems, aiming to optimize energy usage and traffic flow based on real-time conditions, which reduces costs and enhances public safety. These examples highlight how API technology integration allows cities to scale IoT applications sustainably while addressing key urban needs."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"advanced-analytics-and-machine-learning-integration"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning Integration"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"An effective IoT dashboard goes beyond basic monitoring by incorporating advanced analytics and machine learning. Predictive analytics and anomaly detection allow organizations to proactively manage risks, anticipate maintenance needs, and optimize processes based on data trends. Machine learning and AI models can analyze historical and real-time data to detect patterns, predict outcomes, and automate responses, driving operational efficiency and reducing downtime. Dashboards that support AI and machine learning features offer organizations a competitive edge by transforming raw data into strategic insights.\nOne example of a company using AI for real-time data intelligence is CVS Health, which leverages AI in its specialty pharmacy operations to enhance efficiency and accuracy. By integrating artificial intelligence and automation tools, CVS Health manages processes like benefits verification and prior authorizations in real-time, significantly reducing manual steps and increasing processing speed. This approach allows CVS to quickly respond to customer needs and streamline the patient experience, which is especially valuable in high-volume healthcare settings where timely data access is critical.\nTo recap, a powerful IoT dashboard is more than a simple display or enticing visuals—it’s a tool for driving meaningful action. Real-time data monitoring, customizability, integration capabilities, and advanced analytics are key factors that enable organizations to maximize the potential of IoT data. By choosing the right dashboard tools, companies can enhance their decision-making processes, optimize operations, and ultimately achieve a stronger ROI on their IoT investments."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"real-time-data-monitoring-and-alerts","depth":3,"text":"Real-Time Data Monitoring and Alerts"},{"id":"customizability-and-flexibility","depth":3,"text":"Customizability and Flexibility"},{"id":"data-integration-and-interoperability","depth":3,"text":"Data Integration and Interoperability"},{"id":"advanced-analytics-and-machine-learning-integration","depth":3,"text":"Advanced Analytics and Machine Learning Integration"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:5.news:articles:2024-11-8-Blog-Harnessing-Intelligence in IoT.md","_source":"content","_file":"5.news/articles/2024-11-8-Blog-Harnessing-Intelligence in IoT.md","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/news/articles/2024-12-9-press-release-ucifi-joins-oma","_dir":"articles","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"uCIFI® Alliance Joins Forces with OMA SpecWorks","description":"Combined Organization to Add New Focus on “Smart City” Technical Specifications Development to Further Extend Interoperability","layout":"articles","urlImage":"/images/news/uCIFI-Alliance-Joins-Forces.png","imageBackground":"","subtitle":null,"leftLabel":"2024-Dec-09","rightLabel":"OMA","cardID":120,"tags":["news","workshop"],"excerpt":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Combined Organization to Add New Focus on “Smart City” Technical Specifications Development to Further Extend Interoperability"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.openmobilealliance.org/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"OMA SpecWorks"}]},{"type":"text","value":" and the "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://ucifi.org/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"uCIFI® Alliance"}]},{"type":"text","value":" announce today that uCIFI® has transferred its specification-setting work to OMA SpecWorks, establishing a new “Smart City” Working Group that will be created within OMA."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nuCIFI®'s initial mission focused on creating a data model to represent objects and use cases for Smart Cities in an open format, enabling true interoperability between devices and applications."}]}]},"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"em","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Combined Organization to Add New Focus on “Smart City” Technical Specifications Development to Further Extend Interoperability"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://www.openmobilealliance.org/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"OMA SpecWorks"}]},{"type":"text","value":" and the "},{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"href":"https://ucifi.org/","rel":["nofollow"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"uCIFI® Alliance"}]},{"type":"text","value":" announce today that uCIFI® has transferred its specification-setting work to OMA SpecWorks, establishing a new “Smart City” Working Group that will be created within OMA."},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\nuCIFI®'s initial mission focused on creating a data model to represent objects and use cases for Smart Cities in an open format, enabling true interoperability between devices and applications."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The latest release of a series of new Lightweight Machine-to-Machine (LwM2M) objects on the OMA LwM2M registry marks a significant stride toward enriched interoperability and standardized communication in smart city applications and IoT devices.
