It is, however, also successfully used on high-end IoT devices as well. LwM2M is deployed in a variety of verticals, such as smart energy, building automation, precision farming, logistics, etc. The object and resource model defined for LwM2M allows extensibility while maintaining interoperability. More than 300 objects and resources have been specified to retrieve sensor data, control actuators, and manage application data. These objects and resources are free to use and publically available.\n","title":"About LwM2M\n","urlImage":"/images/OMA-129_Lightweight_M2M_Logo_RGB_full.png"},"children":[]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.lwm2m:10.whatis:index.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.lwm2m/10.whatis/index.md","_extension":"md"}]
