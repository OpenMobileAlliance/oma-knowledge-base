The goal is to prevent unauthorized access to devices and their data, and this may include both cyber and physical access, as some breaches may happen when something as simple as a person walking up to equipment and pulling a plug. A recent report shared in IoT News found that 34 out of the 39 most used IoT exploits are over three years old on average. Routers make up 75% of infected IoT devices, providing gateways for attackers to access additional nodes on a network.
