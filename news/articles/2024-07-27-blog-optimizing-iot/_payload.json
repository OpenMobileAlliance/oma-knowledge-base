This protects sensitive and corporate (even government) information from being intercepted or tampered with. Device Authentication is recommended to implement strong authentication mechanisms. The goal is to prevent unauthorized access to devices and their data, and this may include both cyber and physical access, as some breaches may happen when something as simple as a person walking up to equipment and pulling a plug. A recent report shared in IoT News found that 34 out of the 39 most used IoT exploits are over three years old on average. Routers make up 75% of infected IoT devices, providing gateways for attackers to access additional nodes on a network.

Devices must be capable of receiving regular updates to address security vulnerabilities and enhance features, whether that be automated, remote, or part of a planned practice (or as needed). Lastly, implementing role-based access control to limit access to devices and data based on user roles will support in limiting and managing access to critical assets and connected devices.
