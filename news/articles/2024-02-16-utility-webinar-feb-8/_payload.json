They provide essential water, sewerage, and recycled water services to 1.91 million people in Southeast Melbourne. Their burgeoning Internet-of-Things (IoT) asset base currently exceeds 100,000 battery-powered devices across their water and wastewater networks, including sewer level monitoring, pump control, GPS tracking, digital meters, portable valve keys, animal detection, network pressure and flow monitoring, and cathodic monitoring for pipe condition. Their vision is to expand this to approximately 1 million devices over the next four years, requiring a network that not only offers a 10-year battery life but also ensures reliable bidirectional communication for data confirmation, control commands, and precise firmware updates. NB-IoT has proven to be the most suitable choice for their current and future needs.",{"type":14,"tag":15,"props":90,"children":91},{},[92,97],{"type":14,"tag":82,"props":93,"children":94},{},[95],{"type":25,"value":96},"Unveiling LwM2M: The Catalyst for IoT Efficiency",{"type":25,"value":98},":\nMoreover, the LwM2M protocol has emerged as the perfect partner for NB-IoT, enabling scalable, secure, and interoperable device management throughout our network. LwM2M stands out for its robust design tailored for IoT device management, ensuring data format uniformity across brands, the ability to request additional data from devices as needed, and providing a secure control plane.

South East Water reported significant reductions in leaks, demonstrating the protocol's effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Additionally, they have successfully prevented sewage pollution incidents by using level sensors to trigger alerts and operations proactively. LwM2M's adaptability to request additional data or change refresh cycles without device-specific software or firmware updates, and its object-oriented nature, provide unparalleled flexibility. Furthermore, LwM2M's reliable firmware update mechanism, even over poor connections, has enabled them to inform customers about real-time water usage and network issues, facilitating data-driven decisions for proactive network management.",{"type":14,"tag":15,"props":110,"children":111},{},[112,117],{"type":14,"tag":82,"props":113,"children":114},{},[115],{"type":25,"value":116},"The Future is Interoperable: LwM2M's Expanding Ecosystem",{"type":25,"value":118},":\nThe workshop highlighted the growing adoption of LwM2M in utility RFPs and the increasing number of utility suppliers developing LwM2M-based solutions.
