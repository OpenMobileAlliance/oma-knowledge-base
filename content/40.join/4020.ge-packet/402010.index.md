# G&E Participation Application Packet

## Introduction

The **Government & Education (G&E) Participation Program** is a new initiative by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) that enables government agencies and accredited academic institutions to contribute to the development of open, interoperable mobile and IoT standards — such as **Lightweight M2M (LwM2M)** and **smart city object models** — without requiring full OMA membership.

Participation is **free of charge** and provides access to technical discussions, working documents, and collaboration opportunities. While G&E participants do not vote or hold leadership roles, their expertise and public research are welcomed and highly valued in shaping standards that serve cities, communities, and research-driven innovation.

To join, eligible institutions must complete a short application process. Learn more and download the application materials below.
