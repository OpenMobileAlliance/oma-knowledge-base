When we want to show news in a blog-like component, we will just use the ShListCards constructor to call the desired news by cardID. News should be optimised with all the neccessary information within frontmatter of .md file. For more details on how to do so, refer to [ShListCards](/content/8.guidelines/2.components/sh-list-cards.md)
