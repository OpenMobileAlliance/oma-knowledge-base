## Validation Error Code
This tool allows the validation of an Object that is publicly reachable by the tool: https://testdevtoolkit.openmobilealliance.org/OEditor/Legal?back=Default 

* The error codes relevant to single Object Validation are from (403 to 499). 
* In addition, the user needs to validate by hand the criteria provided by error codes (400 to 402).
The information in the OMNA LwM2M Registry is contained in two files:

* <a href="https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/lwm2m-registry/blob/prod/DDF.xml" target="_blank">DDF.xml</a>: this file contains all the Object information that is displayed in the <a href="https://technical.openmobilealliance.org/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html" target="_blank">OMA LwM2M registry</a> (with the exception of the Reusable Resources that are contained in the "Common.xml" file.
* <a href="https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/lwm2m-registry/blob/prod/Common.xml" target="_blank">Common.xml</a>: this file contains the Reusable Resources information that is displayed in the <a href="https://technical.openmobilealliance.org/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html" target="_blank">OMA LwM2M registry</a>.
