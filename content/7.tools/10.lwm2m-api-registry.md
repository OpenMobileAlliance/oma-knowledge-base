<strong>The LwM2M Registry API</strong>, developed and maintained by the Open Mobile Alliance Naming Authority (OMNA)), is a critical tool for accessing metadata information about various objects within the LwM2M ecosystem. Developed by OMA, this API allows users to retrieve detailed metadata for all object versions, specific objects, or the latest object versions through structured URLs. The API provides essential functions such as Objects Discovery and Object Retrieval, with clear error codes to guide users in case of incorrect requests. The metadata includes comprehensive details like object descriptions, identifiers, links to XML descriptions, visibility statuses, technical specifications, unique URNs, and registration ownership. This API is indispensable for developers and organizations looking to integrate or manage IoT devices within the LwM2M framework, ensuring they have access to up-to-date and precise metadata for efficient operation and development.
