## Exploring OMA Specifications

Unlock the Power of OMA's Enablers: With over 220 Enablers, each available in multiple release versions, OMA offers a vast range of possibilities. Explore this wealth of information using our two simple search methods:

1. **Search by Specific Document**: Find a specific document quickly by entering its title, keyword, or document number.

2. **Search by Project or Enabler**: Explore all documents related to a particular project or Enabler by selecting the relevant category.

These methods make it easy to find the technical specifications you need.

## Search by Specific Document
Finding the right documents for each OMA Enabler Release is now easier and more efficient. Follow these steps to find the documentation you need:

1. **Search by Enabler Name**: Enter the name of the Enabler in the search bar. For more accurate results, include specific terms related to the Enabler's functionality or release version.

    * **Example**: For documents related to the "Messaging" Enabler, you might search for "Messaging Enabler v1.2".

2. **Filter Your Results**: Use the advanced filtering options to narrow down your search. You can filter by:

    * **Version**: Specify the version of the Enabler.
    * **Status**: Choose between approved, candidate, or historic releases.
    * **Document Type**: Select the type of document, such as technical specifications, guidelines, or release notes.

3. **Keyword Search**: Use keywords related to the content you need. This can include terms from the document's scope or key features of the Enabler.

> Note: The publications listed in this table include the approved versions for each OMA Enabler and the latest candidates for release versions that still need approval.

> Note: Within the Enabler filter column, the assigned number for each Enabler represents the number of associated documents for that search.

## OMA Registries Overview
The Open Mobile Naming Authority (OMNA) ensures seamless integration and interoperability by managing names and numbers for OMA technologies, including the Lightweight M2M (LwM2M) Registry and other active registries. OMNA simplifies the process and provides clear instructions, making it easy for users to navigate and find necessary information.

### OMA LwM2M Registry

The Lightweight M2M (LwM2M) Registry is supported by OMNA. This registry focuses on managing names and numbers specific to LwM2M implementations, ensuring seamless integration and interoperability within the LwM2M ecosystem.

By simplifying the process and providing clear instructions, we aim to make it easy for users to navigate the OMNA system and find the information they need efficiently.

The Open Mobile Naming Authority (OMNA) is responsible for managing names and numbers to ensure interoperability and compatibility among implementations using OMA technology. OMNA handles names and numbers not managed by other bodies like IANA.

## Other OMNA Registries
In addition to the LwM2M Registry, OMNA manages several other active registries. These registries ensure consistent use of names and numbers across various OMA technologies, supporting interoperability and compatibility among different implementations.

### How the OMNA Process Works

The OMNA process, currently based on the WINA process established by WAP, guides the allocation of names and numbers. Until an OMA-specific version is developed, use the WAP WINA process document as a reference.

### Submitting Requests for Assigned Names or Numbers

To request an OMNA assigned name or number:

1. **Fill Out the OMNA Request Form**: Select the appropriate Name Space.
2. **Review Process**: Your request will be reviewed by the OMNA Secretary and the Release Planning and Management Committee.
3. **Assignment and Recording**: Once approved, the name or number will be recorded in the OMNA database.

You can find the request form on the relevant pages listed below.

### OMNA Administration

OMNA is administered by the OMNA Secretary. If you have any comments or questions about OMNA or its processes, please contact the OMNA Secretary through the OMA Contacts page.

### OMNA Name and Number Database

OMNA maintains several name and number registries. These registries help ensure consistent use of names and numbers across implementations.

The following name and number registries are currently maintained by OMNA.
