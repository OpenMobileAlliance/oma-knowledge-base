### Search OMA Specifications
The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) provides a vast repository of over 220 Enablers, each available in multiple release versions, empowering users to explore a wide range of technical specifications. To facilitate efficient access to this wealth of information, OMA offers two primary search methods. Users can search by specific document titles, keywords, or document numbers for quick retrieval, or they can explore documents related to a particular project or Enabler by selecting the relevant category. These intuitive search tools enable users to easily locate the technical specifications they need, ensuring they can effectively utilize OMA's comprehensive resources.

### OMNA Registries
The Open Mobile Naming Authority (OMNA) plays a crucial role in ensuring the interoperability and compatibility of OMA technologies by managing essential names and numbers across various registries, including the Lightweight M2M (LwM2M) Registry. OMNA simplifies the process for users by providing clear guidelines and a streamlined approach to navigate these registries. This includes submitting requests for assigned names or numbers, which are then reviewed and recorded in OMNA’s database, ensuring consistent use across OMA implementations. Through these registries, OMNA supports seamless integration within the OMA ecosystem, fostering a reliable and cohesive environment for technology deployment.

### OMA APIs
The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) offers a comprehensive inventory of API specifications, organized by protocol bindings such as RESTful, SOAP Web Services, and LDAP. These APIs provide essential tools for developers to interact with and utilize various OMA technologies effectively. The RESTful APIs follow the REST architectural style, enabling operations mapped to HTTP verbs, while SOAP Web Services APIs encapsulate operations within XML documents sent via HTTP POST. LDAP APIs bind operations to LDAP messages, facilitating directory services tasks. This well-organized API inventory serves as a valuable resource for developers, ensuring easy access and a clear understanding of the functionalities available through OMA’s diverse set of APIs.

## OMA Registries Overview
The Open Mobile Naming Authority (OMNA) ensures seamless integration and interoperability by managing names and numbers for OMA technologies, including the Lightweight M2M (LwM2M) Registry and other active registries. OMNA simplifies the process and provides clear instructions, making it easy for users to navigate and find necessary information.

### OMA LwM2M Registry

The Lightweight M2M (LwM2M) Registry is supported by OMNA. This registry focuses on managing names and numbers specific to LwM2M implementations, ensuring seamless integration and interoperability within the LwM2M ecosystem.

By simplifying the process and providing clear instructions, we aim to make it easy for users to navigate the OMNA system and find the information they need efficiently.

The Open Mobile Naming Authority (OMNA) is responsible for managing names and numbers to ensure interoperability and compatibility among implementations using OMA technology. OMNA handles names and numbers not managed by other bodies like IANA.

## OMNA Enabler Registries
In addition to the LwM2M Registry, OMNA manages several other active registries. These registries ensure consistent use of names and numbers across various OMA technologies, supporting interoperability and compatibility among different implementations.

### How the OMNA Process Works

The OMNA process, currently based on the WINA process established by WAP, guides the allocation of names and numbers. Until an OMA-specific version is developed, use the WAP WINA process document as a reference.

### Submitting Requests for Assigned Names or Numbers

To request an OMNA assigned name or number:

1. **Fill Out the OMNA Request Form**: Select the appropriate Name Space.
2. **Review Process**: Your request will be reviewed by the OMNA Secretary and the Release Planning and Management Committee.
3. **Assignment and Recording**: Once approved, the name or number will be recorded in the OMNA database.

You can find the request form on the relevant pages listed below.

### OMNA Administration

OMNA is administered by the OMNA Secretary. If you have any comments or questions about OMNA or its processes, please contact the OMNA Secretary through the OMA Contacts page.

### OMNA Name and Number Database

OMNA maintains several name and number registries. These registries help ensure consistent use of names and numbers across implementations.

The following name and number registries are currently maintained by OMNA.

### OMA LwM2M Registry API
The OMA LwM2M Registry API, also known as the OMNA (OMA Naming Authority), provides essential tools and information for interacting with the OMA Registry. This documentation outlines the available functionalities of the LwM2M Registry API version 1, offering comprehensive details on how to access and retrieve metadata about various objects within the registry.

**Base URL for the Registry API**:
http://www.openmobilealliance.org/api/

#### API Functions and Endpoints
##### Objects Discovery:

* **Endpoint**: lwm2m/v1/Object
    * **Description**: Retrieve a JSON file containing metadata information on all object versions.
* **Endpoint**: lwm2m/v1/Object?ObjectVersion=latest
    * **Description**: Retrieve a JSON file containing metadata information with the latest object versions.

##### Get an Object:

* **Endpoint**: lwm2m/v1/Object?ObjectID=12
    * **Description**: Retrieve a JSON file with metadata information on Object 12.
* **Endpoint**: lwm2m/v1/Object?ObjectID=12&ObjectVersion=latest
    * **Description**: Retrieve a JSON file with metadata information on the latest version of Object 12.
* **Endpoint**: lwm2m/v1/Object?ObjectID=12&ObjectVersion=1.0
    * Description: Retrieve a JSON file with metadata information on version 1.0 of Object 12.
    * >Note: When specifying an ObjectVersion other than "latest", the ObjectID must be included.
#### Error Codes
* **HTTP 400**: ObjectID must be included when ObjectVersion is set to "latest".
* **HTTP 404**: The specified ObjectID and/or ObjectVersion is not found in the registry.

### Metadata Information
The metadata provided by the API defines and classifies objects within the OMA system. This includes descriptions, object names, unique URNs, links to XML descriptions, and more. Key metadata elements include:

* **Description**: Description of the object.
* **Label**: Identifier for who has defined the object (OMA, external SDO, private registration).
* **Name**: Object name.
* **ObjectID**: Unique identifier for the object.
* **ObjectLink**: URL to the XML file describing the object, with visibility settings.
* **SpecLink**: URL to the Technical Specifications, with visibility settings.
* **URN**: Unique URN for the object.
* **Owner**: Organization name that registered the object.
* **Version**: Object version.
* **VortoLink**: DEPRECATED. URL to this object in Vorto.

This comprehensive API documentation ensures users can effectively interact with and retrieve vital information from the OMA LwM2M Registry.


## OMA API Inventory
This section showcases the API specifications managed by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA), organized by protocol bindings such as RESTful, SOAP Web Services, and LDAP. You'll find a comprehensive list of APIs under each protocol binding, with detailed descriptions to help you navigate and understand their functions. This inventory serves as a resource for easily accessing and comprehending the available APIs and their uses.

* **RESTful APIs**: These APIs use the REST architectural style with an HTTP protocol binding. API operations are mapped to HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), allowing clients to query or modify the current state of a resource.

* **SOAP Web Services APIs**: These APIs utilize a SOAP binding, where API operations and their input parameters are encapsulated within an XML document sent via an HTTP POST method.

* **LDAP APIs**: These APIs bind operations to specific LDAP messages, such as AddRequest, SearchRequest, ModifyRequest, and DelRequest, to perform directory services tasks.
