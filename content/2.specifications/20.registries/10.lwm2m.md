### OMNA LwM2M Registry
The Lightweight M2M (LwM2M) Registry is supported by OMNA. This registry focuses on managing names and numbers specific to LwM2M implementations, ensuring seamless integration and interoperability within the LwM2M ecosystem.

By simplifying the process and providing clear instructions, we aim to make it easy for users to navigate the OMNA system and find the information they need efficiently.

The Open Mobile Naming Authority (OMNA) is responsible for managing names and numbers to ensure interoperability and compatibility among implementations using OMA technology. OMNA handles names and numbers not managed by other bodies like IANA.
