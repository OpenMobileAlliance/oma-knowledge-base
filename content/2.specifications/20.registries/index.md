The Open Mobile Naming Authority (OMNA) ensures seamless integration and interoperability by managing names and numbers for OMA technologies, including the Lightweight M2M (LwM2M) Registry and other active registries. OMNA simplifies the process and provides clear instructions, making it easy for users to navigate and find necessary information.

### How the OMNA Process Works

The OMNA process, currently based on the WINA process established by WAP, guides the allocation of names and numbers. Until an OMA-specific version is developed, use the WAP WINA process document as a reference.

### Submitting Requests for Assigned Names or Numbers

To request an OMNA assigned name or number:

1. **Fill Out the OMNA Request Form**: Select the appropriate Name Space.
2. **Review Process**: Your request will be reviewed by the OMNA Secretary and the Release Planning and Management Committee.
3. **Assignment and Recording**: Once approved, the name or number will be recorded in the OMNA database.

You can find the request form on the relevant pages listed below.

### OMNA Administration

OMNA is administered by the OMNA Secretary. If you have any comments or questions about OMNA or its processes, please contact the OMNA Secretary through the OMA Contacts page.

### OMNA Name and Number Database

OMNA maintains several name and number registries. These registries help ensure consistent use of names and numbers across implementations.

The following name and number registries are currently maintained by OMNA.
