### OMA Public Documents
This section offers publicly available documents that are important resources beyond our technical specifications. These include contributions from various working groups such as Architecture, Content Delivery, and Device Management & Service Enablement, each providing valuable insights into their areas. We also have white papers on topics like managing non-IP devices in cellular IoT networks and preparing for 5G, along with guidelines for creating and registering LwM2M objects and logging reusable resources. Additionally, our repository includes Birds of Feathers sessions, an extensive OMA dictionary, and key external references, supporting comprehensive industry knowledge and sharing.
