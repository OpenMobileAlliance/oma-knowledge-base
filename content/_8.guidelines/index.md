Here are the guidelines for everything content creator (or anyone with a little bit of knowledge in web programming) might want to use. 

Here you can play with looks and feel of the website, how to color everything, which font to use, etc.

Also, here are custom components provided, with detailed instructions on how to use them, as well as some basic & advanced examples.

This section is constructed out of two sub-sections:
- [Looks&Feel](/_8.guidelines/looks-feel/)
- [Components](/_8.guidelines/components/)
