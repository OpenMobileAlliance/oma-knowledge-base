<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Property</th>
      <th>Attribute</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="4">ui</td>
      <td>n/a</td>
      <td>The <code>ui</code> property in the component is a configuration object that allows customization of various styling aspects of the component. Each attribute within the <code>ui</code> property targets a specific part of the component display, providing detailed control over its appearance and layout. Below is a detailed description of each attribute within the <code>ui</code> property:</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>wrapper</code></td>
      <td>Defines the overall styling for the carousel container.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>inner</code></td>
      <td>Defines the styling for the inner sliding container.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>indicators</code></td>
      <td>Defines the styling for the carousel indicators (pagination dots).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>items</td>
      <td>n/a</td>
      <td>An array of slide items, each with a component and its props.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>n/a</td>
      <td>Intended to be used as a help to content writer. Doesnâ€™t render on the website.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Config
These style properties can be modified via `ui` and are stored in the `sh-carousel.ts`:

```ts
export default {
  wrapper: "relative flex items-center w-full mt-10 overflow-hidden",
  inner: "flex transition-transform duration-500 ease-in-out",
  indicators: "mt-6 w-full text-center",
  icon: "hover:scale-125 duration-300 dark:text-gray-300 dark:hover:text-gray-100",
  // Default Tailwind CSS values
  default: {
  }
}
```

#### Class Descriptions
These represent the class values utilized in the exported object. These values are customizable and can be strengthened or overridden through the `ui` properties' attributes.

_**wrapper**_
*  **Value**: `"relative flex items-center w-full mt-10 overflow-hidden"`
*  **Description**: Defines the overall container styles. The value `"relative flex items-center w-full mt-10 overflow-hidden"` sets a relative positioning (`relative`), uses flexbox layout (`flex`), centers items (`items-center`), makes the container full-width (`w-full`), adds a top margin of 10 units (`mt-10`), and hides overflow (`overflow-hidden`).

_**inner**_
*  **Value**: `"flex transition-transform duration-500 ease-in-out"`
*  **Description**: Specifies styles for the sliding container. The value `"flex transition-transform duration-500 ease-in-out"` uses flexbox layout (`flex`), adds a transition effect for transform property (`transition-transform`), with a duration of 500ms (`duration-500`), and smooth easing (`ease-in-out`).

_**indicators**_
*  **Value**: `"mt-6 w-full text-center"`
*  **Description**: Defines styles for the indicators (pagination dots). The value `"mt-6 w-full text-center"` adds a top margin of 6 units (`mt-6`), makes it full-width (`w-full`), and centers the text (`text-center`).

_**icon**_
*  **Value**: `"hover duration-300 dark dark:hover"`
*  **Description**: Defines styles for the navigation icons. The value `"hover duration-300 dark dark:hover"` scales up the icon on hover (`hover`), with a duration of 300ms (`duration-300`), and sets text colors for dark mode (`dark dark:hover`).

These style properties ensure that the {{ $doc.constructorName }} is visually appealing and flexible, allowing for a wide range of customization to meet specific design requirements.
