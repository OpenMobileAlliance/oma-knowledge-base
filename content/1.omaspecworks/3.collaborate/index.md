## Welcome to Collaborate with OMASpecWorks

### Collaborate with OMA SpecWorks

OMA SpecWorks is not alone in its role of creating standards, and recognizes the importance of working with other organizations that perform similar or complementary activities. To assist in this effort, OMA SpecWorks has relationships with outside organizations and standards bodies to ensure broad industry participation.  

Liaison agreements with OMA SpecWorks operate in one of three ways:

- Cooperation Framework (CF) provides a set of guidelines agreed (but not formally signed) by OMA SpecWorks and the external organization.
- Cooperation Agreement (CA) where there is a formal, signed agreement in place between the external organization and OMA SpecWorks.
- Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is a signed formal agreement between the external organization and OMA SpecWorks.  

For information on how to form a liaison with OMA SpecWorks, please contact Seth Newberry at [snewberry@omaorg.org](snewberry@omaorg.org).
