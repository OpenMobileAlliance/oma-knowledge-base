### Membership

Are you looking for an Standards Development Organization (SDO) that houses an experienced body of wireless industry contributors, focused on delivering specifications at the services layer that support the billions of new and existing fixed and mobile terminals across a variety of mobile networks, including traditional cellular operator networks and emerging Internet of Things (IoT) networks supporting machine-to-machine device communication?

Are you looking for a work environment that values inputs from companies of all sizes and shapes, provides equal opportunity to contribute, prides itself on transparency, and delivers quality work with real-world value?

Are you looking for a specifications factory that continually strives to optimize the delicate balance between the need for consensus and time to market through tools and simplified procedures, while empowering the people doing the work to complete a work item in the minimal amount of time?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, OMA Specworks is the SDO for you. Contribute to one of our current [working groups](https://omaspecworks.org/about/the-oma-specworks-work-program/), or quickly ramp up a new one to fit your needs.

**At OMA SpecWorks, there is a membership level right for all companies.**
