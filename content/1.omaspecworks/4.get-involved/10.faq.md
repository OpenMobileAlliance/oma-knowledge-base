  - q: "What is OMA SpecWorks?"
    a: "All OMA members operate under the same IPR policy. In the course of specifications work, the Open Mobile Alliance receives contributions in various forms. To best facilitate the dissemination of these contributions, it is necessary to understand any intellectual property rights (‘IPR’) relating to the contributions. About OMASpecworks video."
  - q: 'Why is there a need for a "specifications factory” like OMA SpecWorks?'
    a: 'OMA SpecWorks recognizes the need for engineers to define and create specifications quickly. OMA SpecWorks was established to meet this goal. Developing specifications is a specialized skill that requires flexible procedures, tools for developing and updating the requirements and technical specifications, an infrastructure for testing and maintaining the specifications, and the ability to reach across to other standards bodies to share and reference the work product.'
  - q: "What has changed?"
    a: "he OMA Board looked critically at the standards industry and how OMA fits into it. OMA has a long history of developing inter-related specifications that supported a complex set of services over a mixed bearer network. As the bearer network technologies consolidated and as the service layer matured, our work began to change. The complex procedures we employed to ensure compatibility across service enablers was less relevant. We have set our sights on creating greater working group autonomy and operational efficiency. Simply put, we want OMA to be the best place to get work done quickly and efficiently."

### Q. What has changed?
The OMA Board looked critically at the standards industry and how OMA fits into it. OMA has a long history of developing inter-related specifications that supported a complex set of services over a mixed bearer network. As the bearer network technologies consolidated and as the service layer matured, our work began to change. The complex procedures we employed to ensure compatibility across service enablers was less relevant. We have set our sights on creating greater working group autonomy and operational efficiency. Simply put, we want OMA to be the best place to get work done quickly and efficiently.

### Q. Why merge with IPSO Alliance?
It is an ideal match. IPSO felt they had completed their mission of advocacy for smart objects and were moving in a direction where a specification-track was needed. OMA was already using IPSO objects in its LWM2M work. OMA and IPSO were happy to work together to provide a home for the IPSO work going forward. This is not new to OMA. OMA started its life by rolling up and accommodating other organizations’ work. It’s a smart way to operate because it creates a single place for engineers to work under a common process. The IPSO Alliance brings new ideas and contributors into the SpecWorks community.

### Q. Is anyone else doing what OMA SpecWorks is doing?
Technical associations are formed and launched every year and there are a number of large standards bodies that are active in the communications industry. However, moving a project from an idea to a set of requirements to a technical specification takes an experience that new associations can struggle with. An organization like OMA SpecWorks, with its rich history of specification development, offers an efficient process, leveraging its experience of creating over 200 unique specifications over the last 16 years. The large associations often have many competing priorities and present higher hurdles to establishing new projects. OMA attempts to find the right path to make creating new specification projects easier to start and easier to complete.

### Q. How do you participate in OMA SpecWorks?
It depends on your objectives. All of OMA’s specifications are available for download right from the OMA SpecWorks website. Implementers may get started right away. Companies interested in creating a specification may begin by completing an application and joining OMA SpecWorks. Members can contribute to an existing specification or propose a new project. A minimum number of sponsoring companies must agree to work on a proposed specification for the specification development process to start. This ensures a project will have the resources and staff to move forward and be successful.

### Q. What does OMA SpecWorks hope to accomplish?
OMA SpecWorks is an established Standards Development Organization with worldwide reach and a membership that is expert in mobile networking and the future of service layer specifications for mobile and IOT applications. OMA SpecWorks will be successful if it continues doing what it has been doing for over a decade.

However, innovative ideas are the lifeblood of any specification setting body. OMA SpecWorks’ goal is to seek out companies interested in collaborating on new communications services and developing specifications that will help those services move into wide adoption. OMA SpecWorks has members with huge developer communities and we would expect to see those companies bringing new projects into OMA SpecWorks from emerging business units of their organizations. OMA SpecWorks has a long history of collaboration with other standards bodies and has the opportunity to work in some of their related emerging markets such as healthcare, automotive and industrial controls.

## TestFest Frequent Asked Questions

This section aims to provide an overview of what is an OMA TestFest Event, and
what you can expect out of the Event.

### What is an OMA SpecWorks TestFest?

OMA TestFests are designed to achieve a number of goals, including:

* Ensuring the quality of OMA specifications
* Enabling vendors to verify and test the interoperability of their product
implementations in a multi-vendor environment
* Provide a peer-to-peer networking environment for participants

TestFests are held in a confidential and secure testing environment where
companies can bring their Client or Server implementation(s) based on an OMA
Enabler to test in multiple multi-vendor combinations. These events are open to
both OMA member and non-member companies.

#### When is the next TestFest?

See at the top of this web page.

There are 1 to 2 TestFest events held per year. These events are hosted in a
variety of locations and venues throughout North America, Europe, and Asia.
Registration fees are per implementation (engineers are free to attend) and vary
based on the expenses estimated to cover the event. If you are interested in
hosting a TestFest at your company’s facility, please contact our
[staff](https://omaspecworks.org/contact-us/){ target="_blank"}.

#### Prerequisites for a TestFest

TestFests are open to the public, as long as you fulfill the following criteria
for entry to the event:

* You have a unique implementation of an OMA Enabler, developed by the company
or in direct association with a third party
* You have implemented all mandatory features of the Enabler to be tested
* You have passed any entry conformance or other preparatory tests defined for
the event, listed in the appendix section of the Enabler Test Specifications:
`Entry Criteria for a TestFest`
* You have signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), provided by OMA, prior to
attending the TestFest

#### Registering for a TestFest

The registration link for each event will be included with the TestEvent date
and location on this TestFest homepage. During registration, you will be asked
to select which OMA SpecWorks Enabler you will be testing and if you are a
Client or Server. The specified fee for that event will be due upon registering
and the event information will inform you what the fee covers / includes for the
event.

Once registration closes, OMA SpecWorks staff will create a formal testing
agenda that will be distributed to participants on-site. More detailed travel
and event information, including recommendations on where to stay, a general
overview of the schedule, arriving at the TestFest, and what to expect on-site,
will be distributed via email to all participants as registration is in progress
and once registration closes.

Participating teams may download the test material to be used during the event
under each Enabler.

#### Reporting Test Session Results

When on-site, the Client teams will be required to complete a Test Session
Report for each test session, verified by the Server team. These reports record
the results that apply to all of the test cases that are part of the Enabler
Test Specification defined by the members. Each report is confidential to the
companies participating in that session.

At the end of the TestFest, OMA SpecWorks publicly posts the results of the
event on the [TestFest Events](https://guidelines.openmobilealliance.org/testfests){target="_blank"}
page via a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/dmse-documentation/tree/master/content/en){target="_blank"}.
In the table you will see:

* Who is the Event host, (_if you are interesting in hosting an event please_
_contact the_ [_staff_](https://omaspecworks.org/contact-us/){target="_blank"})
* Physical location of the Event,
* Date of the Event,
* Consolidated test results for all the participants, _available for download
in PDF_, and
* Individual results per company, implementation and version. _See Product
Listing_ below.

The consolidated report provides an indication to the OMA Working Group of both,
the completeness of the Specification as well as the quality of the
implementations that are being tested. Based on the consolidated results from
more than one TestFest Event, the Working Group may decide to formally Approved
the Technical Specifications.

Lastly, OMA SpecWorks hosts a [Product Listing](https://guidelines.openmobilealliance.org/listing){target="_blank"}
page in a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/dmse-documentation/tree/master/content/en){target="_blank"}
where companies have the opportunity to market the implementation that has been
tested.

#### Reporting Issues with the Specification

One of the important aspects of any interoperability testing session is to
record and process the issues found during the TestFest Event. This will allow
the corresponding Working Groups to determine how the issue should be resolved,
TestFest participants may have the opportunity to raise their queries directly
with the corresponding Technical Working Group.

> For LWM2M Test events, participants are asked to submit any issues they
encounter with the specification on the OMA GitHub
[**Issues - LwM2M for Developers**](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/OMA_LwM2M_for_Developers/issues){target="_blank"}.
This repository  is monitored by the [Device Management Working Group](https://lwm2m.openmobilealliance.org/about/){target="_blank"}
Device Management Working Group and the [IPSO Working Group](https://lwm2m.openmobilealliance.org/about/){target="_blank"}.
