## What is LwM2M

The Open Mobile Alliance Lightweight M2M (OMA LwM2M) protocol is a communication protocol designed for managing devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). It provides a standard way to remotely manage and communicate with constrained devices, such as sensors and actuators, which often have limited processing power and memory.

## Components of LwM2M
### LwM2M Architecture
1. **LwM2M Client**: This runs on the device and is responsible for managing local resources and communicating with the LwM2M server.
2. **LwM2M Server**: This is the remote entity that manages the LwM2M clients. It handles tasks such as device registration, reading and writing resources, and executing commands.
3. **Bootstrap Server**: This server helps devices to connect to the LwM2M server by providing initial configuration and credentials.

</figure>

The LWM2M Client may have any number of Resources, each of which belongs to an Object.
Resources and Objects have the capability to have multiple instances of the Resource or Object.
Resources are defined per Object, and each Resource is given a unique identifier within that Object.
Each Object and Resource is defined to have one or more operations that it supports.
A Resource MAY consist of multiple instances called a Resource Instance as defined in the Object specification.

### OMA LwM2M Object and Resource Model
The OMA Lightweight M2M (LwM2M) protocol uses a hierarchical object and resource model to manage and interact with IoT devices. This model organizes the data and functionalities of a device into well-defined objects and resources, making it easier to monitor, control, and manage various aspects of the device.

#### Object and Resource Hierarchy
1. **Object**: An object represents a specific type of data or functionality on a device. For example, an object could be a temperature sensor, a firmware update mechanism, or a connectivity monitor.

2. **Resource**: Each object consists of one or more resources. A resource represents a specific piece of data or a function within the object. For instance, a temperature sensor object might have resources for the current temperature reading, the sensor's unit of measurement, and the sensor's status.

#### Example: Temperature Sensor Object
**Object ID**: 3303 (assigned ID for temperature sensor objects)
* **Resource 5700**: Sensor Value (current temperature reading)
* **Resource 5701**: Sensor Units (units of the temperature reading, e.g., Celsius or Fahrenheit)
* **Resource 5601**: Min Measured Value (minimum recorded temperature)
* **Resource 5602**: Max Measured Value (maximum recorded temperature)
* **Resource 5603**: Reset Min and Max Measured Values (function to reset min/max values)

#### Interaction Model
The LwM2M protocol allows interactions with objects and resources through standard operations:

* **Read**: Retrieve the current value of a resource.
* **Write**: Set the value of a resource.
* **Execute**: Invoke a function on a resource.
* **Observe/Notify**: Subscribe to changes in a resource's value.

#### Controlling Sensors
To control different sensors using the LwM2M protocol, a client on the sensor device registers with an LwM2M server. The server can then interact with the sensors by reading values, writing configurations, and executing commands. For example:

* **Temperature Monitoring**: The server reads the temperature sensor value periodically to monitor environmental conditions.
* **Configuration**: The server writes to resources to change sensor settings, such as adjusting the measurement interval.
* **Firmware Update**: The server can use the firmware update object to remotely update the sensor's firmware, ensuring it has the latest features and security patches.

#### Firmware Update Capabilities
One of the significant capabilities of LwM2M is performing firmware updates on the client itself. The firmware update object allows the LwM2M server to:

* **Upload New Firmware**: Transfer the firmware package to the device.
* **Monitor Update Progress**: Track the status of the firmware update process.
* **Apply Updates**: Install the new firmware, rebooting the device if necessary.

These capabilities ensure that devices can be kept up-to-date with the latest software enhancements and security patches, reducing the need for physical maintenance and improving the overall reliability and security of the IoT deployment.

### LwM2M Guidelines

This content provides guidance on how to define new LwM2M Objects and/or Resources.

>A more detailed explanation can be found in this document: [Guidelines for the Creation and Registration of LwM2M Objects & Resources](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/documents/whitepapers/OMA-ORG-Guidelines_Creation_Registration_LwM2M_Objects_Resources-V1_0_1-20190115-A.pdf)


### LwM2M Objects

#### `Object License`
 * Software license inside of the Object.
   * Each Object in the OMNA LwM2M Registry MUST have a license. Currently, the tool provides only three different type of licenses:
     * `BSD-3 Clause license`. This is the only license that is accepted by One Data Model Registry, (ODM). ODM has created a language that can represent any object/model defined by Standards Development Organizations. For more information see [One Data Model](https://github.com/one-data-model).
     * `OMA BSD-3 license`. To be used by OMA Working Groups only.
     * `Your own license`. Please note that licenses that are not popular, e.g. (MIT, Apache, etc) are strongly discouraged; your Object won't be registered with One Data Model and more than probably won't be used by other members of the community.

#### `Name`
 * Name of the Object.
   * For details see ['Name'](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/lwm2m-registry/wiki/Guidelines#name-1) below.
 * The `Name` value is duplicated in the title of the tool and in the definition of the Object. There is only one single `Name` value.

#### `Description`
 * The object description element should contain a precise and short definition of the purpose of the object. 
 * This value is used to populate the description field in the [OMNA LwM2M Registry](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html). 
 * The length of the description is limited to **134** characters.

### Object Definition

####  Operations
* These are operations related to the [LwM2M Editor](https://devtoolkit.openmobilealliance.org/OEditor/):
  * `Edit`
  * `Save`

#### `Name`
 * `Name` of the Object, is the value that will appear inside the Object file.
 * If the `Name` has more than one word, first letter of each word should be capitalized. 
 * **NOTE:** The **IPSO Working Group**, pay special attention to the meaning of the name. The names should be very specific rather than general. 
>To request support and direction, please contact the **IPSO Working Group** via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/lwm2m-registry/issues).

#### [Object ID](https://technical.openmobilealliance.org/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html)
 
 >**Note:**
 >`Object ID` is formally allocated by OMA staff. 
 >
 >If you would like to reserve an ID please get in contact via
 >[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/lwm2m-registry/issues) or via email: helpdesk@omaorg.org.

#### `ObjectVersion`
 * This is related to the version of the Object.
 >Please ensure that the version is aligned with the definition of the ['URN'](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/lwm2m-registry/wiki/Guidelines#object-urn).

#### `LWM2MVersion`
 * The value of this element indicates the version of the **LwM2M protocol**.
 >Please ensure that this value matches the schema defined in the attribute, e.g.: ```xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="http://.../LWM2M-v1_1"```.
 >
 >**NOTE:** OMA may introduce new schemas, e.g.: ```LWM2M.xsd```, ```LWM2M-v1_1.xsd```, in the future.

#### `Object URN`
 * The composition of this element is: ```urn:oma:lwm2m:<oma|ext|x>:<ObjectID>:<version>```
   * The category: indicates different ranges and stakeholders as described in the `Object ID`.

     * `oma`- Objects Produced by OMA. Only OMA can use this element 
        * e.g urn:oma:lwm2m:**oma**:`<ObjectID>:<version>`
     * `ext`- Objects registered by 3rd party standards organisations or alliances 
        * e.g urn:oma:lwm2m:**ext**:`<ObjectID>:<version>`
     * `x`- Objects registered by companies or individuals 
        * e.g urn:oma:lwm2m:**x**:`<ObjectID>:<version>`

 * `version` indicates the `ObjectVersion`:
   * for `1.0` is omitted from the urn,e.g.: `urn:oma:lwm2m:x:10241`
   * for version increments the urn is updated, e.g.`1.1` **must** be included: `urn:oma:lwm2m:x:10241:1.1`
 
#### `Instances`
 * Two possible values:
    * `multiple` - Indicates that it is possible to have more than one instantiation of the Object.
    * `single` - Indicates that is only one instantiation of the Object.

#### `Mandatory`
 * `Optional` - It is the default value. 
 * `Mandatory` - Value is restricted to some Objects defined by **OMA DMSE Working Group**.

   * `Reusable`
     * Range: `2048 - 26240`.
     * It **MUST** be registered with [OMNA LwM2M Registry](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html).
       * You can use the [LwM2M Editor](https://devtoolkit.openmobilealliance.org/OEditor/) for this registration.
    >Please note that Reusable Resources are selected by entry the number of the Reusable Resource in the Editor.
    >The tool populates, directly, the values for the Reusable Resource from the OMNA LwM2M Registry. 
    >According to the Technical Specifications. 
    >The following elements in a Reusable Resource cannot be modified:
    >  - `Name`, 
    >  - `ResourceID`,
    >  - `Operations`,
    >  - `Type`,
    >  - `Range or Enumeration`,
    >  - `Units`, and
    >  - `Description`
    >
    >If you need to customize the Reusable Resource `Description`, then use `Edit Additional Definition` button at the end of the table.

   * `Private`
     * It doesn't need to be registered with [OMNA LwM2M Registry](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/wp/OMNA/LwM2M/LwM2MRegistry.html).
     * Range: `26241 - 32768`.
     * It is open to re-use.


#### `Resource Name`
 * If the Resource is composed by more than one name, then please capitalize and separate each word.

#### `Resource Operations`
 * The [LwM2M Editor](https://devtoolkit.openmobilealliance.org/OEditor/) restricts the possible values.
 >Please note that if you select the option `E`-`Execute` then, the `Type` **must** be empty.

#### `Resource Instances`
 * The [LwM2M Editor](https://devtoolkit.openmobilealliance.org/OEditor/) provides two possible options:
   * `Multiple`
   * `Single`

#### `Resource Mandatory`
 * This element has two possible values:
   * `Mandatory`
     * It implies that the `Resource` **must** be present as soon as the Object is instantiated.

   * `Optional`
     * It indicates that this `Resource` in that particular Objects is **optional**.

#### `Resource Type`
  * The [LwM2M Technical Specifications](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/) define several  `Type`'s.

#### `Resource Range or Enumeration`
 * Machine-readable definition of valid values for the resource. 
 * Ranges of values are expressed with **two** dots, e.g.: '0..250'. List of valid values can be given as comma separated list. See [Appendix D of LwM2M TS 1.1.1](http://www.openmobilealliance.org/release/LightweightM2M/V1_1_1-20190617-A/OMA-TS-LightweightM2M_Core-V1_1_1-20190617-A.pdf) for details. 
* Explanation of values (if not obvious from the context) should be given in the resource description. 

#### `Resource Units`
 * The `Units` defined in OMA LwM2M Objects are defined by [SenML - Sensor Measurement Lists](https://www.iana.org/assignments/senml/senml.xhtml).
 * In addition to [SenML](https://www.iana.org/assignments/senml/senml.xhtml `Units` two extra values have been added to this list:
   * `TBD` - *To Be Defined*
     * This value is used when none of the `Unit` symbols in the drop-menu list are suitable.
       * This value will trigger the **IPSO WG** to define a suitable `Unit`.
   * `blank` 
     * This value can be used when no `Unit` is necessary. 

 >Please, send your `Unit` suggestion to the **IPSO WG** via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/OpenMobileAlliance/lwm2m-registry/issues).  
 >**IPSO WG** will evaluate if a new `Unit` value will be sent to [IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/senml/senml.xhtml) for registration.

The following guidelines should be followed to maximize interoperability across uses of the units:
* Existing unit identifiers, when available, MUST be used (there must be only one unit identifier for each unit)
* When selecting a unit, the non-scaled SI units SHOULD be preferred over-scaled units (e.g., "m/s" instead of "km/h" for speed)
  * certain scaled units (e.g., "km/h" and "kWh") are being registered to enable use of units for legacy models and in scenarios where scaled units is the industry norm; however number of registered scaled units should be minimal
* There needs to be a compelling use case for registering new units; a reference to the use of the new unit in standards specifications is recommended
  * units that are specific to a single use case or user should not be registered; for such use the unit field can be left empty and semantics of the value can be explained in the description of the resource.  


#### `Resource Description`
 * Be precise and short.
 >Note: Reusable Resources `Description` is fixed during initial definition and must not be changed when used in new objects. If context-specific description of a resource is needed, the object description can be used for this purpose.
