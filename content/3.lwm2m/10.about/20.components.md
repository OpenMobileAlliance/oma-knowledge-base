## LwM2M Architecture
1. **LwM2M Client**: This runs on the device and is responsible for managing local resources and communicating with the LwM2M server.
2. **LwM2M Server**: This is the remote entity that manages the LwM2M clients. It handles tasks such as device registration, reading and writing resources, and executing commands.
3. **Bootstrap Server**: This server helps devices to connect to the LwM2M server by providing initial configuration and credentials.

## LwM2M Resource Model

The LWM2M Enabler defines a simple resource model where each piece of information made available by the LWM2M Client is a Resource.
Resources are logically organized into Objects. The figure illustrates this structure, and the relationship between Resources, Objects, and the LWM2M Client.

### Object and Resource Hierarchy
The OMA Lightweight M2M (LwM2M) protocol uses a hierarchical object and resource model to manage and interact with IoT devices. This model organizes the data and functionalities of a device into well-defined objects and resources, making it easier to monitor, control, and manage various aspects of the device.

1. **Object**: An object represents a specific type of data or functionality on a device. For example, an object could be a temperature sensor, a firmware update mechanism, or a connectivity monitor.

2. **Resource**: Each object consists of one or more resources. A resource represents a specific piece of data or a function within the object. For instance, a temperature sensor object might have resources for the current temperature reading, the sensor's unit of measurement, and the sensor's status.

    * The LWM2M Client may have any number of Resources, each of which belongs to an Object.
    * Resources and Objects have the capability to have multiple instances of the Resource or Object.
    * Resources are defined per Object, and each Resource is given a unique identifier within that Object.
    * Each Object and Resource is defined to have one or more operations that it supports.
    * A Resource MAY consist of multiple instances called a Resource Instance as defined in the Object specification.
