        **OMA, IPSO Alliance, and uCIFI**
    subtitle: |
        Expanding IoT Interoperability with Key Alliances
    text: |
        OMA is strengthening global IoT interoperability by incorporating two major alliances:  

        ### IPSO Alliance (2018)  
        The integration of the **IPSO Alliance** enhanced OMA’s LwM2M framework by adding structured **data models** and **semantic interoperability**. This improved IoT device management across **smart buildings, industrial automation, and energy systems**.  

        ### uCIFI Alliance (2025)  
        In 2025, OMA expanded further by integrating **uCIFI**, an alliance focused on **vendor-neutral** data models for **smart cities and utilities**. This strengthens **standardized communication** across **LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, and mesh networks**.  

        By uniting these efforts, OMA continues to **simplify IoT connectivity, enhance device interoperability, and drive smarter, scalable infrastructure** worldwide.
