        Open Mobile Alliance (OMA)
    subtitle: |
        Enabling Global Interoperability for Mobile and IoT Standards
    text: |
        The **Open Mobile Alliance (OMA**) is a leading industry forum dedicated to driving open, interoperable mobile service enablers and IoT standards. Founded to facilitate innovation and seamless communication across diverse ecosystems, OMA develops specifications that enable global interoperability for connected devices, applications, and services.

        OMA plays a critical role in the standardization of protocols that power the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile networks, and industrial applications. With a focus on efficiency, security, and scalability, OMA’s specifications—such as the widely adopted LightweightM2M (LwM2M) protocol—serve as foundational elements for smart cities, industrial automation, utilities, and next-generation mobile services.

        By fostering collaboration among industry leaders, technology providers, and enterprises, OMA ensures that emerging technologies remain accessible, adaptable, and aligned with evolving industry needs.

        OMA, IPSO Alliance and uCIFI
    subtitle: |
        Strengthening IoT Interoperability Through Strategic Incorporations
    text: |
        As part of its commitment to advancing IoT interoperability, OMA has expanded its ecosystem by incorporating two key organizations:

        ### IPSO Alliance (2018)
        In 2018, OMA integrated the IPSO Alliance, a global organization focused on promoting smart object interoperability in IoT deployments. IPSO’s expertise in defining data models and semantic interoperability significantly enhanced OMA’s LwM2M framework, strengthening its capabilities in device management and data representation. The incorporation of IPSO allowed for more structured, scalable IoT solutions, benefiting sectors such as smart buildings, industrial automation, and energy management.

        ### CIFI Alliance (2025)
        In January 2025, OMA further broadened its reach by incorporating the uCIFI Alliance, a key industry player dedicated to open, unified data models for smart cities and utilities. uCIFI’s mission aligns with OMA’s goals of promoting vendor-neutral, standardized communication across diverse networks, including LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, and mesh technologies. By integrating uCIFI’s work, OMA strengthens its influence in smart infrastructure, providing a unified approach to managing and exchanging data across connected cities and utility networks.

        Through these strategic incorporations, OMA continues to drive the evolution of IoT standards, ensuring a seamless, interoperable future for smart devices and connected ecosystems worldwide.

        LightweightM2M and Wireless Innovation
    subtitle: |
        Bringing Ideas to Life for IoT and More
    text: |
        Home to the industry-leading LightweightM2M (LwM2M), OMA enables market-leading corporations and small start-up companies alike to come together to build the next generation of wireless.
        The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) absorved the IPSO Alliance with a new mission to build technical documents including specifications, smart objects, and white papers for a connected world, enabling interoperability across networks and growth in fixed and mobile wireless markets and the Internet of Things (IoT).
