For the OMA LightweightM2M (LwM2M) protocol, the following test specification documents were created to support its various versions:

### 1. Enabler Release Package (ERP)
- **OMA Enabler Release Package (OMA ERP)** is a comprehensive bundle of specifications, guidelines, and associated documentation provided by the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA). This package facilitates the deployment of specific mobile services or technologies across different networks and devices. Each OMA ERP typically includes:

    1. **Core Specifications**: Detailed technical specifications that define the functionality and requirements of the enabler (e.g., messaging, browsing, or device management).

    2. **Test Cases**: A set of standardized test cases that ensure interoperability and compliance with the defined specifications across different platforms.

    3. **Reference Implementations**: Sample implementations that demonstrate how the specifications can be applied in real-world scenarios.

    4. **Deployment Guidelines**: Best practices and guidelines for network operators, device manufacturers, and service providers to efficiently deploy and integrate the enabler in their systems.

OMA ERPs aim to promote interoperability, reduce fragmentation, and streamline the deployment process of new mobile services, ensuring that different stakeholders in the mobile ecosystem can support and utilize the same technological standards.


### 2. Requirements Document (RD)
- **[LightweightM2M_RD]:** This document outlines the specific requirements for the LwM2M protocol, defining what the protocol must achieve in terms of functionality, interoperability, security, and performance. It serves as the foundation for both technical and test specifications.

### 3. Core Technical Specifications (TS)
- **[LightweightM2M_TS_Core]:** This is the central document that defines the core architecture and functionality of the LwM2M protocol. It details the object model, communication mechanisms, and the overall structure of LwM2M implementations. The test specifications for core functionalities are derived from this document.
  
- **[LightweightM2M_TS_Transport]:** This document specifies the transport mechanisms supported by LwM2M, including UDP, TCP, SMS, and more recently, MQTT and HTTP. It is crucial for ensuring that the protocol operates effectively over various network transports. Test cases specific to transport layers are outlined based on this document.

### 4. Supplemental Specifications (SUP)
- **[LwM2M Schema]:** The LwM2M schema defines the XML data models used in LwM2M. The schema ensures that devices correctly implement and interpret the data exchanged in an LwM2M environment. Testing against this schema ensures data consistency and correctness.

### 5. Test Specification Documents (TS)
- **[LwM2M Test Specification]:** This document includes detailed test cases and procedures tailored for LwM2M implementations. It covers core functionalities, transport-specific tests, and security aspects. The specification ensures that an LwM2M implementation meets all necessary technical requirements and behaves as expected under various scenarios.

### 6. Conformance Test Plan (CTP)
- **[LwM2M CTP]:** This plan outlines the structured testing approach for validating LwM2M implementations. It describes the order of tests, preconditions, and specific environments in which the tests should be executed. It ensures comprehensive coverage of all protocol features.
