    **LwM2M: A Smart & Secure IoT Protocol**
subtitle: |
    Built for Efficiency, Security, & Scalability
text: |
    **Lightweight Machine-to-Machine (LwM2M)** is a **device management protocol** designed for **low-power IoT devices** operating in constrained environments. Developed by the **Open Mobile Alliance (OMA)**, it provides:  

    - **Remote device management** for firmware updates, security patches, and monitoring.  
    - **Efficient communication** using **CoAP, UDP, and MQTT** for low-bandwidth networks.  
    - **Secure data transmission** with built-in encryption and authentication.  
    - **Interoperability** with standard **IoT frameworks and data formats (CBOR, JSON, SenML, TLV)**.  

    Each **new version of LwM2M** introduces **enhanced security, broader network compatibility, and optimized performance** for the evolving IoT landscape.
