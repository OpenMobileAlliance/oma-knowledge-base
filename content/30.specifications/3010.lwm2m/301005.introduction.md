### LwM2M Resource Model

The LwM2M Enabler defines a simple resource model where each piece of information made available by the LwM2M Client is a Resource. Resources are logically organized into Objects. The figure illustrates this structure, and the relationship between Resources, Objects, and the LwM2M Client.
