# SDF Quality Names

OMA has registered a [Semantic Definition Format (SDF)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-asdf-sdf/) Quality Name Prefix "oma" in the [IANA registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/sdf/sdf.xhtml#sdf-quality-name-prefixes) for SDF Quality Name Prefixes. OMA uses this prefix to include LwM2M specific information in the LwM2M models represented with SDF.

OMNA SDF Quality Names Registry maintains the SDF quality names that can be used together with the registered prefix.

The following table table contains currently registered quality names.

| Quality Name | Description                                        | Applicable for                            |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| id           | LwM2M Object or Resource ID for the SDF definition | sdfObject, sdfProperty, sdfAction, sdfData|


The following CDDL provides extensions to the [SDF feature CDDL](https://github.com/ietf-wg-asdf/SDF/blob/master/sdf-feature.cddl) for the registered quality names.

```
$$SDF-EXTENSION-OBJECT //= ("oma:id" => uint)
$$SDF-EXTENSION-DATA //= ("oma:id" => uint)
$$SDF-EXTENSION-ACTION //= ("oma:id" => uint)
```
