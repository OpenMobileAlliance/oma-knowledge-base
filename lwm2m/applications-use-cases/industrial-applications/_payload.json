This specification details the various transport bindings available within the LwM2M protocol stack, as depicted in Figure 4-1, illustrating their integration with messaging protocols. These transport options, including CoAP over different layers and technologies like UDP, TCP, SMS, and emerging Non-IP protocols, ensure that LwM2M can adapt to a wide range of network environments, enabling seamless device communication and management.
