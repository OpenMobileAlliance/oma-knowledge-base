This specification details the various transport bindings available within the LwM2M protocol stack, as depicted in Figure 4-1, illustrating their integration with messaging protocols. These transport options, including CoAP over different layers and technologies like UDP, TCP, SMS, and emerging Non-IP protocols, ensure that LwM2M can adapt to a wide range of network environments, enabling seamless device communication and management. Additionally, the use of OSCORE with these transport bindings offers enhanced security, catering to the diverse needs of modern IoT deployments."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"figure","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n    "},{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"src":"/images/lwm2m/protocol_stack.svg","alt":"Procotol Stack"},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n    "},{"type":"element","tag":"figcaption","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Protocol Stack (LwM2M)"}]}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[{"id":"example-temperature-sensor-object","depth":3,"text":"Example: Temperature Sensor Object"},{"id":"interaction-model","depth":3,"text":"Interaction Model"},{"id":"controlling-sensors","depth":3,"text":"Controlling Sensors"},{"id":"firmware-update-capabilities","depth":3,"text":"Firmware Update Capabilities"},{"id":"conclusion","depth":3,"text":"Conclusion"},{"id":"lwm2m-messaging-procol","depth":2,"text":"LwM2M Messaging Procol"}]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.lwm2m:20.applications-use-cases:20.industrial-applications.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.lwm2m/20.applications-use-cases/20.industrial-applications.md","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/lwm2m/resources/_dir","_dir":"resources","_draft":false,"_partial":true,"_locale":"","title":"LwM2M Resources & Tools","_id":"content:3.lwm2m:30.resources:_dir.yaml","_type":"yaml","_source":"content","_file":"3.lwm2m/30.resources/_dir.yaml","_extension":"yaml"}]
