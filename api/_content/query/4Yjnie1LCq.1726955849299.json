As the bearer network technologies consolidated and as the service layer matured, our work began to change. The complex procedures we employed to ensure compatibility across service enablers was less relevant. We have set our sights on creating greater working group autonomy and operational efficiency.

The large associations often have many competing priorities and present higher hurdles to establishing new projects.

A minimum number of sponsoring companies must agree to work on a proposed specification for the specification development process to start.
