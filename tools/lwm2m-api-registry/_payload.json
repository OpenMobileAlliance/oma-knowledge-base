The API provides essential functions such as Objects Discovery and Object Retrieval, with clear error codes to guide users in case of incorrect requests. The metadata includes comprehensive details like object descriptions, identifiers, links to XML descriptions, visibility statuses, technical specifications, unique URNs, and registration ownership.
