It is, however, also successfully used on high-end IoT devices as well. LwM2M is deployed in a variety of verticals, such as smart energy, building automation, precision farming, logistics, etc. The object and resource model defined for LwM2M allows extensiblity while maintaining interoperability. More than 300 objects and resources have been specified to retrieve sensor data, control actuators, and to manage application data. These objects and resources are free to use and publically available.\n","title":"About LwM2M\n","urlImage":"/images/OMA-129_Lightweight_M2M_Logo_RGB_full.png"},"children":[]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:3.lwm2m:10.whatis:index.md","_source":"content","_file":"3.lwm2m/10.whatis/index.md","_extension":"md"},{"_path":"/lwm2m/applications-use-cases/use-cases","_dir":"applications-use-cases","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Industry Use Cases","description":null,"layout":"doc","body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Energy Sector"}]},{"type":"text","value":": Manage smart grids, monitor energy consumption, and control distributed energy resources."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Smart City"}]},{"type":"text","value":": Managing streetlights, traffic sensors, and environmental monitoring devices."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Transportation"}]},{"type":"text","value":": Track and manage fleet vehicles, optimize logistics, and monitor vehicle health."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Industrial IoT"}]},{"type":"text","value":": Monitoring and managing machinery, sensors, and actuators in a factory setting."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Smart Agriculture"}]},{"type":"text","value":": Remote management of soil sensors, weather stations, and irrigation systems."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Smart Manufacturing"}]},{"type":"text","value":": Monitor and manage machinery, sensors, and production lines for efficiency and predictive maintenance."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Healthcare"}]},{"type":"text","value":": Managing wearable health monitors and medical devices."}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"advantages"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Advantages"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"ul","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Scalability"}]},{"type":"text","value":": Capable of managing a large number of devices."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Efficiency"}]},{"type":"text","value":": Designed for low power and low bandwidth environments."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"li","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Flexibility"}]},{"type":"text","value":": Supports a wide range of devices and use cases."}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The OMA Lightweight M2M protocol provides a robust, secure, and efficient way to manage IoT devices, offering numerous benefits to industries.
